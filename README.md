# Introduction

Welcome to **ChroneX**, an ambitious trading engine. The name blends **Chrono**, the Greek god of time, with **eX**, representing exchange and execution.

# Currently in Early Development
ChroneX is at the very beginning of its journey. Right now, we're laying the groundwork, defining the architecture, and shaping the vision for what’s to come. There’s nothing built yet, but exciting plans are in motion.
